<h2>Description</h2>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Site Purpose</strong>:&nbsp;Provide a brief statement about the purpose of the website drawing upon the client's functional specifications, the industry and any fictitious but viable goals that you deem to be reasonable.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Target Audience</strong>:&nbsp;Research who the&nbsp;website visitors will be by&nbsp;discovering the industry, visiting similar sites and asking your friends, family or acquaintances through an informal survey about the industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may elect to develop <a href="https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/personas.html" target="_blank">personas</a> for the distinct type of&nbsp;site visitors. This section should describe the target audience being judicious about the selection of the most plausible demographics.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Site Map</strong>: The site map is a sketch of all the website pages and references. It should illustrate the relationship between those pages.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Color Scheme</strong>:&nbsp;The color scheme refers to the carefully selected site colors that reflect the organization's purpose and trademark colors. Note that Salmon River Adventures does not have established colors for brand identity. The planning document defines the color scheme through a color palette that labels color style definitions and swatches for site elements.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Typography</strong>: The project specifications require that you utilized the directory of open source designer web fonts provided by fonts.google.com. The typography section of the planning document provides examples of the fonts to be used and where they are to be applied.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Wire-frame Sketches</strong>: Produce wireframe sketches of your site design considering the purpose, specifications, and target audience. You should include sketches for small, medium, and large views respectively meaning ~smart phones, ~tablets and ~large width monitors.</p>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Save your completed planning document as a<strong> PDF </strong>file<strong>&nbsp;</strong>and post it as&nbsp;a new thread in the <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=212799&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=byui_production-1230066" target="_self">Planning Document Discussion Board</a> for peer review. Return to the discussion board to review <strong>two</strong>&nbsp;peer submissions no later than&nbsp;Wednesday of Lesson 13.
